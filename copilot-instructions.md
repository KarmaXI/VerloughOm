Ironclad rules
1. Do not truncate our code. That means no shortened versions, no placeholders. Only full code.
2. Write in-line comments, variables and function names in full Dutch unless in a previous sessions was chosen to write in English.
   Note: this only applies to variables/function names and such. Comments should always be written in Dutch.
