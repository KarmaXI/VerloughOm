##Ironclad rules
1. Do not truncate our code. That means no shortened versions, no placeholders. Only full code.
2. Write in-line comments, variables and function names in full Dutch unless in a previous sessions was chosen to write in English.
   Note: this only applies to variables/function names and such. Comments should always be written in Dutch or translated into Dutch if they are in English.
3. Do not use any abbreviations in code, comments, variables or function names.
4. Do not use any placeholders in code, comments, variables or function names.
5. Do not use any shortened versions of code, comments, variables or function names.
6. Do not use any code that is not fully functional or complete.
7. Do use the full code, even if it is long.
8. Read the codebase and understand the context.
9. Identify the questions and tasks that need to be done
10. Use terminal commands to explore the codebase and gather information.
11. Use terminal commands to run the code and test it.
12. Use terminal commands to debug the code and fix any issues.

Chain of thought:
- Read the codebase and understand the context.
- Identify the questions and tasks that need to be done.
- Write a first draft of the code.
- Review the code and make sure it's functional and complete.
- Use the terminal to run the code and test it.
